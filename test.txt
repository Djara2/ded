This is me trying to use my text editor. It appears that it actually saved the file contents this time.

I am having fun using this thing. It appears to be functioning without any problems.

It is also quite fast, and very minimal. And, it only uses 1MB of memory.

The next thing to figure out is to display lines numbers.
